# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project is an interactive movie recommendation system built using Python and Jupyter notebooks in Google Colab. The system allows users to filter and get movie recommendations based on several criteria such as movie name, language, IMDb rating, running time, year of release, and maturity rating.
